  <h1> Available Dogs: </h1>

  <div class="column">
  <h2> Otto </h2>
    <p> Otto is big, strong, and sleek as a jungle cat. When you first meet him, he can come off as a tough, stoic dog. Give him a little time to warm up, though, and you'll see his other side - the side that curiously explores new things and places, charms the pants off new human friends with his huge smile, and affectionately follows his people around. </p>

  <div class="column">
  <h2> Vickie </h2>
    <p> This sweet girl looks for affection from any of her people, those she lives with and brand new acquaintances, nudging with her nose and then leaning into them for petting and rubdowns. She loves the attention, but doesn't really demand it, just grateful for the love she gets. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
  <h2> Mustang Sally </h2>
    <p> Sally picks up new tricks nearly instantly - a prominent local trainer called her a "sponge," and "the kind of dog trainers love to work with". She is an agility queen. She is a champion snuggler. She loves to run, play, learn new tricks, and explore, and she loves, loves, loves spending time with her many admirers. </p>
